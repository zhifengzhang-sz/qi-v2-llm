## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized interface for integrating AI models with time series data and analysis. When combined with Cline AI's coding capabilities and VS Code's robust development environment, MCP becomes a powerful framework for developing time series models and AI applications.

This guide explains how to set up, configure, and effectively use these tools together to accelerate your development workflow, with a special focus on time series analysis for quantitative finance, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Cline AI](https://cline.ai/) installed on your system
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Remote Containers extension
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- Git
- The QI development environment cloned from the repository

## Setting Up Your MCP Environment

### 1. Initial Setup

First, configure your development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/zhifengzhang-sz/qi-v2-llm.git
cd qi-v2-llm

# Run the setup script
npm run setup
```

### 2. Configure AI Integration

Set up your preferred AI model for use with Cline AI:

```bash
# Source the zsh configuration to access MCP functions
source ~/.zshrc

# Initialize the MCP environment for Cline AI
mcp-cline-init
```

### 3. Start the MCP Server

```bash
# Navigate to the MCP directory
cd cline-mcp

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the MCP server
npm start
```

You should see output indicating that the MCP server is running, typically on port 3000.

import mcp.time_series as ts

# Load financial data
data = ts.load_data('path/to/financial_data.csv', date_column='Date', value_column='Close')

# Perform seasonal decomposition
decomposition = ts.decompose(data, period=252)  # For daily financial data with yearly seasonality

# Visualize components
ts.plot_decomposition(decomposition)

# Create and fit a forecasting model
model = ts.create_model('arima', order=(1,1,1))
model.fit(data)

# Generate forecasts
forecast = model.forecast(steps=30)
ts.plot_forecast(data, forecast)
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Cryptocurrency Price Analysis

This example demonstrates how to use MCP with Cline AI to analyze cryptocurrency price data:

```python
# Import required libraries
import mcp.time_series as ts
import mcp.crypto as crypto
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch BTC/USDT data for the past 6 months
btc_data = crypto.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1d', since='6m')

# Convert to dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(btc_data, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)

# Detect market regimes
regimes = ts.detect_regimes(df['close'], n_regimes=3)
print(f"Detected {len(regimes)} distinct market regimes")

# Visualize with regime highlighting
ts.plot_with_regimes(df['close'], regimes, title='BTC/USDT Price with Market Regimes')

# Calculate volatility
df['volatility'] = ts.calculate_volatility(df['close'], window=14)

# Identify volatility anomalies
anomalies = ts.detect_anomalies(df['volatility'], method='iqr')
print(f"Detected {len(anomalies)} volatility anomalies")

# Forecast next 10 days
forecast = ts.forecast(df['close'], method='prophet', periods=10)
ts.plot_forecast(df['close'], forecast, title='BTC/USDT 10-Day Price Forecast')
```

### Example 2: Economic Indicator Analysis

This example shows how to analyze economic indicators using the MCP tools:

```python
# Import required libraries
import mcp.time_series as ts
import mcp.economic as econ
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch GDP and inflation data
gdp = econ.fetch_indicator('GDP', country='US', start_date='2010-01-01')
inflation = econ.fetch_indicator('CPI', country='US', start_date='2010-01-01')

# Synchronize the time series
aligned_data = ts.align_series([gdp, inflation], freq='Q')

# Perform Granger causality test
causality = ts.granger_causality(aligned_data)
print("Granger Causality Results:")
print(causality)

# Create a VAR model
var_model = ts.create_model('var', lags=4)
var_model.fit(aligned_data)

# Generate impulse response functions
irf = var_model.impulse_response(periods=12)
ts.plot_irf(irf, title='Impulse Response Function: GDP vs Inflation')

# Forecast next 8 quarters
forecast = var_model.forecast(steps=8)
ts.plot_var_forecast(aligned_data, forecast, title='GDP and Inflation 2-Year Forecast')
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Custom MCP Tool Development

You can extend the MCP environment with your own time series tools:

1. **Define Tool Specifications**:
   ```javascript
   // In src/server/mcp-tools.js
   const timeSeriesTools = [
     {
       name: 'custom_decomposition',
       description: 'Perform custom time series decomposition',
       parameters: {
         data_path: 'Path to the time series data file',
         method: 'Decomposition method (custom, stl, loess)',
         period: 'Number of observations per cycle'
       }
     }
   ];
   ```

2. **Implement Tool Functionality**:
   ```javascript
   // In src/server/tool-handlers.js
   async function handleCustomDecomposition(parameters) {
     // Implement your custom decomposition logic here
     // This could call Python scripts, R functions, or other services
     
     return {
       status: 'success',
       components: {
         trend: [...],
         seasonal: [...],
         residual: [...]
       }
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Register with MCP Server**:
   ```javascript
   // In src/server/mcp-server.js
   app.post('/execute', async (req, res) => {
     const { tool, parameters } = req.body;
     
     if (tool === 'custom_decomposition') {
       const result = await handleCustomDecomposition(parameters);
       res.json(result);
     }
     // Handle other tools...
   });
   ```

### Integration with External Systems

MCP can integrate with external data sources and compute environments:

1. **Cloud Data Sources**:
   - Configure connections to cloud databases
   - Set up API access to financial data providers
   - Implement caching for frequently used datasets

2. **High-Performance Computing**:
   - Connect to remote compute clusters for intensive calculations
   - Offload large-scale simulations to specialized hardware
   - Schedule batch processing jobs from your development environment

3. **Collaboration Platforms**:
   - Share analysis results through integrated reporting
   - Push visualizations to dashboards
   - Schedule automated analyses and notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Connection Problems**:
   - Verify the server is running on the expected port
   - Check Docker network configuration
   - Ensure firewall settings allow the connection

2. **Tool Execution Failures**:
   - Check logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify input data format and parameters
   - Ensure required dependencies are installed

3. **Performance Issues**:

   - Consider data sampling for exploratory analysis
   - Optimize computation-intensive operations

### Debugging Techniques

1. **MCP Server Debugging**:
   ```bash
   # Run server with debugging output
   DEBUG=mcp:* npm start
   ```

2. **Tool Execution Tracing**:
   ```javascript
   // Add to src/server/mcp-server.js
   app.post('/execute', async (req, res) => {
     console.log('Tool execution request:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
     // Existing code...
     console.log('Tool execution result:', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
   });
   ```

3. **Client-Side Debugging**:
   - Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests
   - Check console output for errors
   - Implement verbose logging for MCP client operations
